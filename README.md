Getting Started
------------
the following Node.js tutorial shows the concept of deploying an application to the IBM cloud, follow the steps and you'll have a fully integrated application on the cloud.  

Pre-requisites: 
 * IBM cloud account.
 * Cloud Foundry CLI.
 * GIT.
 * Node.
 
## Step 1 : clone the sample app.
clone the nodeJs app from github 

```
git clone https://github.com/malekerramli/ibm-cloud-ci-poc
```
## Step 2 : run the app locally.
Use the npm package manager to install dependencies and run your app.
  * cd into the cloned directory
  ``
$ cd ibm-cloud-ci-poc
``
  * install the dependencies via the package manager.
  ``
$ npm install
``
  * run the app
  ``
$ npm start
``





 



* **Clean, intuitive design** — With Slate, the description of your API is on the left side of your documentation, and all the code examples are on the right side. Inspired by [Stripe's](https://stripe.com/docs/api) and [PayPal's](https://developer.paypal.com/webapps/developer/docs/api/) API docs. Slate is responsive, so it looks great on tablets, phones, and even in print.

* **Everything on a single page** — Gone are the days when your users had to search through a million pages to find what they wanted. Slate puts the entire documentation on a single page. We haven't sacrificed linkability, though. As you scroll, your browser's hash will update to the nearest header, so linking to a particular point in the documentation is still natural and easy.

 
 ## Step 3 : prepare the app for deployment.
 
 ## Step 4 : deploy the app.
 
 ## Step 5 : add a database.
 
 ## Step 6 : use the database
